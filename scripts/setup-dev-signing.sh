#!/bin/bash
# One-time local dev signing setup (#13c). Creates a STABLE self-signed code-signing identity
# ("TermTile Dev Signing") in the login keychain so `build-app.sh` signs with a constant code identity.
# Why: ad-hoc signing ("-") produces a fresh cdhash every build, which silently RESETS every macOS TCC
# grant (Accessibility, Input Monitoring) on each rebuild — you'd re-approve TermTile after every build.
# A stable identity keeps the grants; you approve once and they persist across rebuilds.
#
# This does NOT help distribution — real users need Developer ID + notarization (the v0.5.0 milestone).
# It only stabilizes LOCAL dev builds. Idempotent: no-op if the identity already exists.
#
# macOS may prompt to unlock your login keychain during import, and codesign may prompt "Always Allow"
# on first use — that's expected (a one-time click), and cheaper than re-granting permissions forever.
